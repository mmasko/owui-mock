# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Diagnosis**
- Repository: `owui-mock` (project site - good choice!)
- URL: `https://username.github.io/owui-mock`
- Problem: GitHub Actions workflow failing (red X)
- Result: "File not found" error because deployment never completed

## 🛠️ **Solution: Simplified Workflow**

The current workflows might be too complex. Let's use a simpler approach:

### **Step 1: Replace Workflows**
Delete the existing workflows and use this simple one:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pages.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### **Step 2: Verify Repository Settings**
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Save settings

### **Step 3: Check File Structure**
Make sure these files exist in your repository root:
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `admin.html` 
- ✅ `assets/` folder with CSS, JS, etc.

### **Step 4: Manual Trigger**
After pushing the new workflow:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

## 🔧 **Alternative: Simple Branch Deployment**

If GitHub Actions keeps failing, try the classic approach:

1. **Repository Settings → Pages**
2. **Source**: "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Branch**: `main`
4. **Folder**: `/ (root)`
5. **Save**

This bypasses GitHub Actions entirely and deploys directly from your main branch.

## 🚀 **Expected Result**
After fixing the deployment:
- **Main Site**: `https://username.github.io/owui-mock/`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://username.github.io/owui-mock/admin.html`

## 🐛 **If Still Failing**
Check the Actions tab error logs and share the specific error message - I can help debug the exact issue.
