# GitHub Pages Deployment Options

## 📚 **Types of GitHub Pages Sites**

### **1. User/Organization Site (yourusername.github.io)**
- **Repository name**: Must be exactly `yourusername.github.io`
- **URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io`
- **Limit**: Only **ONE** per GitHub account
- **Purpose**: Your main personal/organization website

### **2. Project Sites (unlimited)**
- **Repository name**: Any name (e.g., `owui`, `my-project`, `chat-app`)
- **URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`
- **Limit**: **UNLIMITED** - you can have as many as you want
- **Purpose**: Individual project websites

## 🔧 **Your Current Situation**

Since you named your repo `owui.github.io`, GitHub thinks this is your **main user site**. You have two options:

### **Option 1: Keep as User Site (Recommended if this is your main site)**
- **Repository**: Keep named `owui.github.io`
- **URL**: `https://owui.github.io` (clean, no subdirectory)
- **Limitation**: This becomes your main GitHub Pages site

### **Option 2: Convert to Project Site (Recommended for this project)**
- **Repository**: Rename to just `owui` or `mock-chat-assistant`
- **URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io/owui`
- **Benefit**: You can still create your main `yourusername.github.io` site later

## 🚀 **Recommendation: Convert to Project Site**

I recommend renaming your repository to `owui` because:
- ✅ You can have unlimited project sites
- ✅ Keeps your `yourusername.github.io` slot available for a main portfolio site
- ✅ Still gets automatic GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Clean URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/owui`

## 📋 **How to Convert to Project Site**

### **Step 1: Rename Repository**
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to "Repository name"
3. Change from `owui.github.io` to `owui`
4. Click "Rename"

### **Step 2: Update Workflows (I'll do this for you)**
The workflows will work the same way, just the URL will change.

### **Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

## 🌐 **Final URLs After Conversion**
- **Main Site**: `https://yourusername.github.io/owui/`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://yourusername.github.io/owui/admin.html`

## 💡 **Future Flexibility**
After converting to a project site, you can later create:
- `yourusername.github.io` - Your main portfolio/personal site
- `yourusername.github.io/project1` - Another project
- `yourusername.github.io/project2` - Another project
- And so on...
